    "We will be covering one more type of model for creating chatbots. As we saw the cosine similarity model works on using that algorithm to find similarities between 2 sentences. But can we now use a neural network to solve this problem? Lets take a look.\n",

    "It’s a Model to create the word embeddings, where it takes input as a large corpus of text and produces a vector space typically of several hundred dimesions. it was introduced in two papers between September and October 2013, by a team of researchers at Google. The underlying assumption of Word2Vec is that two words sharing similar contexts also share a similar meaning and consequently a similar vector representation from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance: “Bank”, “money” and “accounts” are often used in similar situations, with similar surrounding words like “dollar”, “loan” or “credit”, and according to Word2Vec they will therefore share a similar vector representation. \n",
